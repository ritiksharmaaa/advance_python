# abstract class 

a class derived from EBC class which belong to abc module is known as abstract class in python.

in django we make abstract user class do make our own user class . 

abc class is know as Meta class which means a class that define the behaviour of other classes . So we can say meta class abc defines that the class which is derived from it becomes an abstract class . ( mean when you inherit class . your behaviou alredy define in that class which you inherit .)

abstract class can have abstract methods and concrete methods . 

abstract class need to be extends and its methods implement . 


impo - python virtual machine can not create objects of an abstract class .

ex : - 

firrs you have to a class from module . 

- in normal class we make class methods and static methods but in abstract you have to use abstract methods decorators . 

from abc import Abc , abstactmethod  # this is actual a built in module in python .



class Father(ABC):  # this class called abstrat class . 
     # absttract methods . 

---------------------Abstract methods ---------------------------

 abstract method is a method whose action is redefined in the child class as for the requirement of the object.

(mean in parebt class methods are made -but not define there .  we have inherit or define- mean make function with pass statement and put @abstractmethod decorater on that -  )


abstract method 

fro abc imort Abc , abstractmethod


class Father (ABC): # this class called abstrsct class 
    @abstractmethod   # define abstract methods 
    def disp(self , or pass parmaete):
        pass # this is compulsory to give passs statement    ---method without body .




--------------------concrete methods ----------------------






    



normal class which we made in class caliied concretemethod 


ex : 

class m:
   def show(self):  - meyhod with body 
      print(" i am concrete methods . ")

-----------------

pVM can not create objects of an abstract class .

It is not necessary to declare all methods abstract in a abstract class.

Abstract class can have abstract method and concrete method.

If there is an abstract method in a class that class must be abstract.  (mean if you use abstract you need to inherit some type of class)

The abstract method of an abstract class must be defined in its child class or subclass--
ex : 

class Father(abc) have abstract method  -- if you make a chile class you need to define pass method (abstract method ) also in child and sub class .


if you are inherit any abstract class that have abstract methods you must either provide the implementation of the method or make this class abstract.


------------------when use abstract class ----------

we use abstract class when there are some common feature shared by all the objects as they are . 



ex:

defence force :  # defence force is abstract class 

  feature : 
     gun = ak47 
     area =


we make some class by inherit : 

class Army (defence force):
    # here 
    gun = ak47   # here this thing have auto maticall came we can just change area , gun is all redy ak 47 so we dont need to write it here . 
    area = land 
class Aitforce(defence force):
    # here also 
    gun = ak47 
    area = air 
class Navy(defnc force ):
    # here also 
    gun = ak47 
    area = water 

# here we make there class if we defien this thing in each class why we not do somethign that we can use to reduce  to wrtie code . so what happen to abstract class . 

so this class is not made . it just provide that code . only it not use directly . 




same as ---- you see interface same it work like that .
