# pickling 

pickling is a process of converting a class object into a bite disturbing so that it can be stored in 2 or 5 this is also called as object serialization.

we use a pickling module to do pickling and unplicking 
. 

related things and fucntion nedd to learn pickling : - 

function : - 

  dump() - this function is used to perform the peckling it returns the pickled representation of the object as a bits object instead of writing it to a file.

  this module belong to pickle module . 

  syntax : - 

  import pickle 

  pickle.dump(object , file )



  -------------unplicking -------

  unpickling is a process where by its stream is convert back into a class object it is inverse operation of pickling this is also called a de - serialisation.
  Pickling and unpickling should be done using binary files since they support by byte streams . 

  we use picklr module to perform pickling and unpicking . 



  warning : - Thickle model is not secure against enormous or malignous construct data never unpickled data received from an untrust  or an unauthorized source.



  load() - these function is used to wield and pickled objects from a binary file and return it into object this method belongs to pickle module.

  import pickle 

  pickle.load(data or file )





  --- why we need pickling

  When we stored some structured data in the file and want to perform calculation that time we need pickling and unpickling.


  mean if we want to store stud data date is like stu name , roll class , fname mname , so we store this data  in object so we can give structure way to store data .
