dotted module names .

- A package can have one or more module which means a package is a collection of module and packages.

A package can contain packages package is nothing but a directory/folder . 

mean : - package mean file inside file . 


create packages : - 

Packages is nothing but a directory- folder which must contain a special file. 

calles __init__.py 


__init__ = what they do ? - I love you file can be empty it indicate that the directory its contain is a python package so it can be imported the same way a model can be imported. 



: - How can import packages : - 

Note : It is not mandatory it can also work when you are not initialise these files 


syntax : - 

import packagename/foldername import module 
or 
import packagename.subpackagename.modulename import function . 

ex : - 

import admin.service  here service is py file which conatain function . 
- 
import admin.common.footer . 


--------------------------- how to acces variable function methods , class etc --------------------------------

function: - 

 import admin.servie.function() 
from package import module name 



----------------------how we can acces 10/8 module -------------

apop package __in it __dot PY code define a list name __all __it is taken to be the list of module named that should be imported when from package import star is encounter. 

. write this code inside __init__ file 


__all__  = ['all module name list ']

access 

from package import * - this can run __all__ import module .

tech , user 

tech have product module , user have request module 

how we can run . 


to run we have to reach top where we can see all sibiling package an on that dir 

we have run python -m user.request.py  - 


here -m flag what they do : -
