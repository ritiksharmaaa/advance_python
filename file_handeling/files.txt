file is collection of date is available for programe we can reterivi use data stored in a file whenever we required .

.txt : - date store in text formate .

Advanatage :-

- stored data is permananent someone remove it . 
- stored data can be shared . 
- it is possible to update or remove . 


type of file :  two type . 

text file - store character and string 

binary file :  - it stored date in the form of bytes a groups of 8 bits each . it is used to store text images pdf , csv , vidio and audio . 

ex .txt , .pdf , .mp4 , .mp3 . .csv 




use : for small site use file else use database . 



modes to open file : - 

it tell for which  file open for which ourpose . 


--- 


text mode and binary mode : - 

a file open in text mode treats its content as if it containe text string of the str type 

when you get data from a text mode file , python first decode the raw bytes using either a platform-dependence encodeing or specified one .



binary mode :- 

a file open in binary mode python uses the data in the file without any decoding mode reflect the raw data in the file .



--------------------------------open file 

if we want to use a file or it data first we have to open it .

open() - this function is used to open a file it return a pointer{mean when ever we open msoffice file his pipe cursor alway present in the first here also samee} to the beigning . 
of the file . this open file handler or file object .

syntsx : - 

open( filename , mode , buffrong , encoding=None , errors=None , newline=None closdefd=None , openner=None )


----

mode - r for read w for write - it default r 

bufffring - just like data vidio buffer in binary 0 in text 1 or any defult no - 8848 8454

encoding - name of the encodingused to decode and encode the file , it should be used only in text mode : ex- utf-8

error - an optional sgring that how encoding and decoding erros are to handel this cannot be used in binary mode , some of the standard strict , ignore , replace  etc .

opner - a custom opner can be used by passing callable as opner 



--------------textfilemode --------

r - reading  pointer \ begning 
w - writing  - if file not prsent it crete it .
x- mean it is alos for write but if yiu doubt this file name is alredy exting you use x when file alredy have it will say file exting alredy erro . 
a - appending | pointer at the end 
r+ = for reading than writing 
W+ open for writing and then reading , it will overide exiting file 
a+ open for appendinf 


--------------binary mode --------

same just at b to ever mode . ab , rb , wb , xb , rb+ wb+ ab+ - just work on binary data . 


closing file -------------


close() - this method is used to close . 

once we close the file objects  ideleted from the memory hence fike will be no longer accessible unless we open it again . 

if you dont explicty close a file python garbage collector will eventually destroy the object and close the ooen for a while so you should always close thef file . 

but its not good way you hve always close it . 



what happen when you dont't want to close the files . 

file may be corupt 
memory utilization is not freed it may cause of insufficent memory 



------------------file object variable ----------

name - this show the name of specifie file 

syntax: - 

file_object.name 

mode - file_object.mode - give file open in which mode . 

this will check wheter file has closed or not 

it show true of file is closed else false 



----methods -- file_object  --lot we see few 

readable() - check the method is used to check whether file is readable or not it return true if file is readable else return Flase 

syntax :- 

   file_object.readable()

   same as writeable() 


----------------------------check file exit or not --------


is_file() - this method is used to check wheather specified file is exist or not this method belongs to path module which is sub module . 

os.path.isFile(filename )

if  os,path.isFile(filename):
     than open edit and do what ever you want 
else :
    print(no data )




__________________________- write a file --------------------


write() - this method is used to store / write character or string into the file represent by file object , it return the number of chsracter written 

sntax : 

filez-object.write(string)

use valid mode to write data 

in w mode data will be overide .   so use f.write multple time so it write you multiple data at a time 


---------------writeline ----

writeline() - this method is used to store / write group of string (list tuple , set ) into file represented by the file objects .

it save data in one single line or attact with each other . 



----------------reading data from file 

read(size) - use to read data 
where size represnt number of bytes to be read fro the begining of the file. 

when file is ommited or negative the entire file will beread and returned . 


mutiple time read with size inrease 2 2 mean 1234 byte learn . 


-----------------readline() -  or readlines() 
this is used to read singe line from file .  or whole line 



---------------------------------methods -- tell == seek methods . 


tell() - this method is used to find current position of file pointer of file pointer from begining of the file position start from ()
f = open('student.txt' , 'r')

f.tell() # give you current postion of the pointer .
data = f.read(5)  than it reed hello and his position shifted to 5 
f.tell() tell postion 5 



-------------seek 

seek(position) - this method is used to move file pointer from one postion to another position . from begining of th efile . position starts from () and it must be positive number . 


-------  use r+ w+ a+ are use same as normal --

but focuus on pointer because after writing pointer at end than you reed it so nothing and vice versa 



----------copy data fromone file to onother file ---


f1 = open("student.txt, 'r' )
f2 = open("student1.txt, 'w' )
data = f1.read()
f2.write(data)
f1.close()
f2.close()


-----------------with statement ----------

the with statement can be used while opening a file 

when we open a file using with statement there is no need to close the file explicty.

syntax : - open('file.txt' , 'r, w, a ') as file_object 

ex : - 

with open('student.txt' , 'w') as f :
    f.read() erite what you want .
