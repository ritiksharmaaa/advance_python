  All classes in python are built from a single super class called object so whenever we create a class in python object will become super class for the internally.

  class Mobile(object):
      

The main advantage of inheritance is code reusability.



-----------------why do we need inheritancwe -------

suppose we have two class employe and manger . 

thay have so many methody same in employe and manager , and some difrrent method in both class. 

here we have to eirite this methods twice which have same . 


-------------type of inheritance ------------

we have four type of inhertance : - 

single inheritance 
multi-level inhertance 
hieararchical inheritance 
muliple inhertance 


declartion or derivation of class . 

class childclass(parentclass):
     memeber of child class 


-----------------------single inhertance --------

If a class is derived from one base class parent class is called single inheritance.


object to father class to son class .


syntax : - 

 classs parentclass(objet):
    memeber of parent class
