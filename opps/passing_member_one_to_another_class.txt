# members members are all all the methods and attributes which we are defined inside a class we wanted to get all this methods and methods to an another class.

members = init method , and methods inside class 

class student :
    def __init__(p , q):  -----------------------
        self.page = p 
        self.q = q 
    #instance method 
    def disp(self):
        print(self.page)
        print(self.q)
                       -------------------------


so this code between this to line is called member 

now we want to pass this all functionality to new class where we know why we use static .

-----------

class User:
   @staticmethod
   def fetch_upper_functionality(upperfunction):
       print(upperfuntcio or call it method here )
    

let call it --------------------see sending member on to another 

stu = student("webpage" , "queue")  # first class insatnce 

udata = user()
u.fetch_upper_functionality(udata)  here we are passing upper functionlity to another class and use it .
