# Python class is a group of attributes and  methods .

what is attributes : -
  Contribute are represented by variable that  content data

what is methods : - 
  method performance action or task it is similar to function

how to create class :-

  class Classname: -----classname(object): -- this class made by this objects - but it is not madate.
      def __init__(self):   this is a constructor 
         self.variable_name = value  # this two are attribute . 
         self.variable_name = value 
      def method_name(self):  here you saw this is similar to fucnton but this is a variable that why we put self .
         --- body of methods .


class - class keyword is used to create a Class.

objects - Object represent the basic class name from where all classes in python are derived the class is also derived from object class this is optional.  (mean class made objects .....) 

These classes also derived from object class this is optional.



__init__() - This method (special methods called construtor )is used to initialize the variable this is a special method we do not call this method explicitly.


self -Self is a variable which refer to current class instance/ object 

---------rule -----------------to ---------made -------class 

this class name can be any valid identifier.

it can't be python reserved words.

class generaly start with capital letter - 

 - and that rule which we happen in python .

 -------------------------


 object is class type variable or class instant to use a class we should create an object to the glass

 instance creation represent alloting memory neccesary to store the actual data of the variable .(mean en = class())

 Each time you create an object of class a copy of each variable defined in class is created.

 object_name = class_name() 
 object_name = class_name(arg)


----

A block of memory is allocated on heap the size of allocated memory is to be decided from the attribute and the methods available in theclass(mobile)

After alotting memoryblah the special method in it is called initialize these methods stored the initial data into the variable.

Re allocated memory location address of the instance is written in two objects(realme)

The memory  location is passed to self.



accesing class member using object.----


We can access variable and method of a class using class object or instance of class.

object_name.variable_name
object_name.variable_name(arg)

self - Self is a default variable that contain the memory address of a current object.

The variable is used to refer all the instance variable and method.


when we create object of class the object name contains the memory location of the object.

The memory location is internally passed to self as self know the memory address of the object so we can access variable and method of object.

Self is the first argument to any object method because the 1st argument is always the object referencethis is automatically whether you call itself or not.

def__init__(self):

def how_model():


Each time you create an object of a class a copy of each variable define in the class is created.
