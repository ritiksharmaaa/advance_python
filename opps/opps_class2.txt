# namespace in python : - learn after class variable 

in In Python name space represent a memory block where name are mapped to object

Class Namespace - a klas maintain its own namespace known as glass namespace in the class name space the names are mapped  to class variable.

instace Namespace - Every instace have it s own namespace know as insatce namespace , in the namespace the name are mapped to instance variable .

------------

class Mobile:
    fb = yes  there class variable point out yes === so this yes is called namespace (mean name who getting space it ) 

    we ame soe insatnce object = realme redmi geek -- this point out the class - so this is called instace name space mean (thsi all getting the fb from class ) the instace which store -- called -- insatce namespace .


we now we we cahnge the class variable in outside so it change for all outside instace ------

Note = but if you want to change  for paticular instance .

so you have change instance variable model = you just change outside = fb.model = this , this is happen for only one instance object --  not for all same you have to do with class variable .

so you can chage also like tht :- 

instance.classvariable = "change value "

instance methods --------------

-- accessor methods 
-- mutator methods 


class methods ------------ in variable class or static are same but it hase diffrent in methods .....

static methods -------------

: -------


-----------------instance methods ---------------

instant methods are the method which act upon the instant variable of the class 
instance methods need to know the memory address of the instance which is provided
 through self variable by default as first parameter for the instant method.


-------it a normal method which we made inside class objects .------------



-------------------class MEthods -------------------
# first First method is CLS in class methods .

# we have You have two type of methods first one is with parameter and second one is without parameter.

# so inside methods you can use is manuplate it any many more .

# calling class methods without argument 

# class Monile : @classmethod(cls): def Show_model(cls)


realme = Monile()
realme.show_model() # that way you use class methods withourt parameter .

--------

class Mobile:
    fb = 'yes'
    @classmethod
    def show_table(cls , r )
        cls.ram = r   # here we are setting value .



calling class method with parameter 

realme.show_model(paramter which is define in function )




-----------------------static methods --------------------

static method are used when some processing is related to the class but does not need the class or its instance to perform any work.

The huge static method when we want to pass some variable from outside and perform some action in the method.

(mean do or get some data from otside and run in class inside fucntion / methods )

decorator - - 

@ decorator -@staticmethod - Need to write about the static methods

syntax : - 

@staticmethods 
def get_data():
    fetch data from 
    run some calulation and use inside it .
