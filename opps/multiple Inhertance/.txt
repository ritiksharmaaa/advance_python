If a class is derived from more than one parent class than its called multiple inherited.


here fater and motehr two parent - and on child who inherit father or mother property . 

class father:
   pass
class mother:
   pass 
class son(father , mother ):
    pass 


    here this two parameter in inhertance called multiple inhertance . 
    


Mro ---------------- method resolution order ()Mro


In the multiple inheritance scenario member of Class R search for in the current class if not found then source continuously into parent class in depth - first left to right manner without searching the same class twice.


mean - 

search for the child class before going to its parent class.

- when a class is inherited from several classes it search in the order from left to right in the parent class.

- it will not visit any class more than once which means a class in the inheritance hierarchy is transverse on me once exactly.

firs son con call now it never call agin . thanit call father 
than father con call and his constructor call - than super call for object here not have constructor 

so it gos downwar mean left to mother - call moterh constructor here super call for object , but it never call construnctor who call alreday so here object end constructor on moterh .
